# SudokuImporter
If you come across a Sudoku in a PDF or without an interface for punching in numbers and hints, or if you come across a Sudoku with an interface you don't like, this may be helpful!

Simply screenshot your Sudoku, import it into the webpage, align the 9x9 Sudoku grid, and get to solving.

## How to use
If you enjoy solving puzzles from Sudoku World Puzzle Federation (WPF), but don't want to bother with printing out the puzzles and solving them manually, you can follow these steps to add an overlay for easier solving.

1. Find a puzzle you'd like to solve and screenshot it. Here's I'm using Sudoku WPF 2022 Round 2 puzzle 10 ([click "Competition Puzzles" here](https://gp.worldpuzzle.org/content/competition-puzzles-96)).

3. With the green grid overlay, align it over the sudoku. (Use the square on the bottom right to resize the grid, and drag the grid around for aligning)

4. Once aligned, press "Confirm Grid" and start solving. For control hotkeys, refer to the next section.
